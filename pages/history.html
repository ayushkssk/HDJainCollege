                    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-8">Established on 21st January, 1942, H.D. Jain College, Ara was the first institution of higher learning ever set up in the economically and academically backward region of Shahabad in fact, the first college between Patna and Varansi.
                        'It owes its foundation to the Late Babu Har Prasad Das Jain, a rich landlord and philanthropist of the town. He himself had little formal education but was a great lover of learning and firmly believed that progress and learning
                        walked arm in arm. He executed a trust deed and donated all his property to charities in 1918.He founded Sri Adinath Trust and set apart sixty thousand rupees for setting up a college at Ara in 1919.</p>
                    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-8">Needless to say he was inspired to do so owing to his indomitable love of learning and innate philanthropy. He had the support and co operation of his close friends Sri Suparshwadas Gupta, an educationist and retired magistrate, Sri
                        Chakreshwar Kumar Jain, Sri Nirmal Kumar Jain and Babu Awadh Bihari Sharan, a legal luminary of the town.</p>
                    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-8"> Unfortunately Babu Harprasad Das Jain passed away untimely in 1920 and the college somehow or the other didn't see the light of the day till 194 1. However, it was founded on the auspicious day of Vasant Panchami (21" January) in 1942.
                        SriAdinath Trust generously donated Rs. 1,55000 for its functioning and management. The college was named after Babu Harprasad Das Jain as a grateful tribute to the blessed soul.Within a few years of its inception the college made
                        great strides; its fame spread far and wide and students from almost all parts of Bihar and the neighbouring state of UP started pouring in. On account of its high standard ofquality teaching and academic pursuits it made a mark
                        as one of the leading institutions of Bihar and won recognition even on the national level. In deference to the request of the college Governing Body the erstwhile ruler ofDumraon, Maharaja Bahadur Ram Ran Vijay Prasad Sing , donated
                        21 bighas and 10 Katthas of land to this college in the heart of the town. A small hostel was initially built on that piece of land, and later on a large hostel wasconstructed there with the aid of the UGC. </p>
                    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-8">
                        The college was affiliated to Patna University, then the only University in Bihar. Initially it was granted permission to impart teaching in Arts and Commerce faculties upto graduation level. Teaching in Science faculty was started in 1951. Recognizing
                        the standard of its quality teaching Patna University granted permission for teaching Honors Courses in Hindi and Economics in 1945, and thereafter in Political Science in 1953. </p>
                    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-8">In 1952 Patna University was converted into a teaching cum-residential university and Bihar University was set up as teaching-cum affiliating university. As a result, this college was shifted to Bihar University as one of its affiliated
                        units. The universities were further reorganized in 1962 and this college was again shifted to Patna University but only for a short while. As Magadh University came into being in 1962 itself, all the colleges except those of Patna
                        University under the jurisdiction of Patna division were made its units. H.D.Jain College was made the first constituent unit of Magadh University and was granted permission to impart teaching up to Honors standard in all subjects
                        of Arts, Science and Commerce streams.The college established itself as one of the few leading colleges of Bihar on account of its rich library, well managed reading room, well equipped laboratories, reputed teachers, inspiring
                        leadership, well regulated discipline and enviable results. One cannot ignore the key role the College Governing Body played in creating, promoting and maintaining a healthy academic atmosphere, high standard of teaching and discipline.
                        The succeeding G Bs worked devotedly for the all round progress of the college. Setting aside the narrow considerations of caste, creed, community, religion and region, they appointed talented teachers of character solely on merit.
                        The teachers too devoted themselves to studies, teaching and research with zeal and passion and expanded the dimensions of knowledge by their research works and scholarly writings. With a view to facilitating research the college
                        G B granted study leave to teachers, sanctioned generous grants for the purchase of reference books and research journals in the college library and extended financial aid to the teachers along with study leave to participate in
                        and present research papers at seminars and conferences. Moreover, the college G B paid pay and perks to the teachers timely at par with the teachers of Patna College and other government institutions. Seminars, symposia and popular
                        lectures were regularly organized for the benefit of students and teachers. The college published its magazine regularly and brought out the creative talent of its students, teachers and other members of the staff.</p>

                    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-8">Conceding the popular demand, Magadh University administration opened P.G. Centers on its campus in 1972 73 and added new feathers to its glory. Initially postgraduate teaching was started in Economics and Political Science but in
                        compliance with the popular demand permission was granted to impart PG teaching in Hindi, Psychology and Chemistry in 1983 84. The college continued its onward journey and got permission for PG teaching in all the subjects of Arts,
                        Science and Commerce streams. By the year 1986 87 H.D. Jain College, elevated itself to become a PG College and got the recognition of the U.G.C. also as a Post Graduate College. Responding favorably to the long pending popular
                        demand of the region, the Govt. of Bihar set up a University, named after the great hero and martyr of the first war of independence of 1957, Veer Kunwar Singh at Ara in 1992. H.D.Jain College is the nucleus of this University.
                        <br> The college takes pride in the fact that a number of its alumni and teachers rose high and occupied enviable positions in almost all spheres of academic, administrative and public life. Even today the college is striving hard
                        to persist with excellence and reach greater heights. There is no denying the fact that this college is no exception to the noticeable decline in the academic atmosphere and deterioration in the teaching standard in the state.
                        However, the college has left no stone unturned to arrest the declining trend and retain its glory. It doesn't wish to take pride in its past glory; it looks forwards to the future and hopes to gain ground. We firmly believe in
                        the hoary wisdom of our sages. <br> Men, let your hearts be One; <br> Let your minds be One; <br> Let your ends be One So that you could act in unison <br> And attain all your goals.</p>
